          <h4>Agriculture</h4>
          <p>Agriculture is inherently vulnerable to changing climate.  Climate-smart management decisions have the potential to improve agriculture’s adaptive capacity
            and reduce climate change impacts. We improve the understanding of historical and future food systems by analyzing climate variability, developing future 
            climate scenarios, and exploring the relationship between agricultural systems and local climate.</p>

          <h4>Northeast Precipitation</h4>
          <p>The Northeastern United States has experienced a substantial increase in heavy precipitation over the last century. We characterize the temporal 
            and spatial attributes of this increase, investigate the climatological mechanisms that have led to enhanced heavy precipitation, and explore the 
            implications of extreme precipitation on flooding.</p>

          <h4>Crop Modeling</h4>
          <p>Irrigated croplands are essential to food production and responsible for the vast majority of human water consumption. Crop models have the potential 
            to inform the management and expansion of irrigation to reduce global hunger, but typically have simplistic representations of irrigation. We are developing 
            new models and frameworks to better understand the future of irrigated agricultural systems.</p>

            of historical Lyme disease expansion and predict future Lyme disease incidence for the northeastern United States using models of tick dynamics and Lyme 
            disease prevalanece, with a focus on the role of climate and land cover.</p>

        GEOG 19.01: The global agricultural sector faces the
        significant challenge of feeding a
        population projected to increase to 9
        billion by mid-century under an evolving
        climate. This course will explore the      
        physical geography of agricultural
        production systems throughout the
        world with an emphasis on the interactions
        between crops, climate, water, soils,

        Climate is a fundamental driver of populations,
        economies, and cultures. Over the past century,
        humans have been modifying the atmosphere
        through the emission of greenhouse gasses. This
        course will provide an overview of the Earth’s
        climate system and the physical basis, impacts,
        and societal dimensions of climate change.</p>

        of water on Earth. We’ve built cities in deserts
        supplied with water from hundreds of miles away,
        extracted enough groundwater to alter the Earth’s
        gravitational field, and dammed sixty-five percent 
        of global freshwater flows. This course will
        introduce students to the physical geography of
        water, survey human interactions with water through
        case studies from around the world, and explore how
        climate change and population growth will affect future
        quality and the availability of water.</p>

                <p>Jonathan Winter is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Adjunct Associate Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College. Before moving to the Upper Valley in the summer of 2013, Jonathan was an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University Earth Institute and a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. Jonathan received his PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his undergraduate studies at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, NY.
                  Outside of academia, Jonathan spends his time traveling, hiking, exploring VT/NH with his family (wife Teresa, sons Lucas, Nolan, and Henry, dog Taz), snowboarding, and trying to find the latest and greatest food and music.
                  A current version of Jonathan’s CV is available <a href="https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/sites/dartmouth.edu.faculty-directory/files/winter_cv_dec2019.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Natalie Teale is a postdoctoral fellow with the Dartmouth Society of Fellows. Her research interests are centered on precipitation variability and its related impacts. She anticipates investigating the hydroclimatic variables associated with streamflow in the northeastern US with the goal of understanding how climate change affects high-impact hydrologic events. She earned a PhD in Geography from Rutgers University, a MS in Geography from Texas A&M University, and a BA in Earth Sciences and Geography from Syracuse University. Prior to moving to New Hampshire, she taught in the Geography Department at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
                    Outside of academia, Natalie enjoys gardening, hiking, and exploring the regional scenery. </p>

Chris entered Dartmouth planning on studying earth sciences, and his introduction to climate modeling began when he met Charlotte Cockburn (MS student in the Department of Earth Sciences) who was his TA in EARS 1. Chris plans to major in Earth Sciences and has an interest in pursuing climate research following graduation. Outside of academics, Chris is a member of the Men’s Club Hockey team and enjoys playing golf, hiking, lifting weights, and spending time with his dog</p>

          <p><b><u>Postdoctoral Researchers:</u></b> There are several Dartmouth Postdoctoral Fellowships available. In addition, the Department of Geography has two 
                  2-year postdoctoral fellowships. Finally, based on qualifications and area of research, postdoctoral positions are sometimes available directly 
                  through the group.<br>
                   <br>
            <b><u>Graduate Students:</u></b> Students pursuing an MS or PhD join the group via the Department of Earth Sciences. The deadline for applying to the 
            Earth Sciences Graduate Program is mid-January, and I strongly encourage prospective students to discuss your background and research interests 
            with me in advance of this deadline.<br>
            <br>
            <b><u>Undergraduate Students:</u></b> Projects currently being recruited for are posted on the Undergraduate Research Projects Database. I am also interested
            in mentoring student-developed projects supported by Dartmouth Undergraduate Research and advising Department of Geography senior honors theses.
