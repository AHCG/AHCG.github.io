      <p style="color:white">The global agricultural sector faces the significant challenge of feeding a population projected to increase to 9 billion by mid-century under an evolving climate. This course will explore the physical geography of agricultural production systems throughout the world with an emphasis on the interactions between crops, climate, water, soils, and technology.</p>
        <a href="https://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Geography/GEOG-Geography/GEOG-19-01"> <img src="/Dartmouth-AHCG/img/Clim_Fut_Ag.jpeg" alt="Logo"> </a>
      <p style="color:white">Climate is a fundamental driver of populations, economies, and cultures. Over the past century, humans have been modifying the atmosphere through the emission of greenhouse gasses. This course will provide an overview of the Earth’s climate system and the physical basis, impacts, and societal dimensions of climate change.</p>
        <img src="/Dartmouth-AHCG/img/Global_Climate_Change.jpeg" alt="Logo">
      <p style="color:white">Humans have radically altered the distribution of water on Earth. We’ve built cities in deserts supplied with water from hundreds of miles away, extracted enough groundwater to alter the Earth’s gravitational field, and dammed sixty-five percent of global freshwater flows. This course will: 1) Introduce students to the physical geography of water, 2) Survey human interactions with water through case studies from around the world, and 3) Explore how climate change and population growth will affect future quality and availability of water.</p>

                <p>Jonathan Winter is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College. Before moving to the Upper Valley in the summer of 2013, Jonathan was an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University Earth Institute and a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. Jonathan received his PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his undergraduate studies at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, NY.
                  Outside of academia, Jonathan spends his time traveling, hiking, exploring VT/NH with his family (wife Teresa, sons Lucas, Nolan, and Henry, dog Taz), snowboarding, and trying to find the latest and greatest food and music.
                  A current version of Jonathan’s CV is available <a href="https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/sites/dartmouth.edu.faculty-directory/files/winter_cv_dec2019.pdf">here</a>.</p>

Her research uses regional climate modeling to predict future climate change in this region. Before landing in New Hampshire, Charlotte earned a BS in Earth System Science from McGill University in Montreal. Charlotte also worked in McGill’s Global HydroLAB, studying the causes and impacts of river intermittency at a global scale.
                  Outside of work, Charlotte enjoys skiing, embroidery, hiking, and making very lopsided vases in the ceramics studio.</p>

                <p>Natalie Teale is a postdoctoral fellow with the Dartmouth Society of Fellows. Her research interests are centered on precipitation variability and its related impacts. She anticipates investigating the hydroclimatic variables associated with streamflow in the northeastern US with the goal of understanding how climate change affects high-impact hydrologic events. She earned a PhD in Geography from Rutgers University, a MS in Geography from Texas A&M University, and a BA in Earth Sciences and Geography from Syracuse University. Prior to moving to New Hampshire, she taught in the Geography Department at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
                    Outside of academia, Natalie enjoys gardening, hiking, and exploring the regional scenery. </p>

                <p>Christopher Picard is an undergraduate assisting with analyzing mean and extreme precipitation changes across the Northeast United States using regional climate model simulations and observational data sets. Chris entered Dartmouth planning on studying earth sciences, and his introduction to climate modeling began when he met Charlotte Cockburn (MS student in the Department of Earth Sciences) who was his TA in EARS 1. Chris plans to major in Earth Sciences and has an interest in pursuing climate research following graduation.
