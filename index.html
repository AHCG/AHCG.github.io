      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Agriculture is inherently vulnerable to a changing climate. Climate-smart management decisions have the ability to improve agriculture’s adaptive capacity and potentially mitigate climate change impacts. We aim to inform agricultural and decision support models through analyzing historical climate variability, developing future climate scenarios, and exploring the relationship between agricultural systems and local climate.</p>

        The Northeastern United States has experienced a substantial increase in heavy precipitation over the last century. We aim to characterize the temporal and spatial attributes of this increase and investigate the climatological mechanisms that have led to increased heavy precipitation.</p>
        <img src="/Dartmouth-AHCG/img/Northeast2.png" alt="Logo">
      <p>
        Crop models can be used to quantify plant water requirements, predict the impact of water shortages on yield, and calculate water productivity. However, current algorithms are not well suited to water limited areas. We are developing a new framework to simulate growth stage based deficit irrigation under limited seasonal water availability.</p>

                <p>Jonathan Winter is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College. Before moving to the Upper Valley in the summer of 2013, Jonathan was an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University Earth Institute and a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. Jonathan received his PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his undergraduate studies at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, NY.

Outside of academia, Jonathan spends his time traveling, hiking, exploring VT/NH with his family (wife Teresa, sons Lucas, Nolan, and Henry, dog Taz), snowboarding, and trying to find the latest and greatest food and music.

A current version of Jonathan’s CV is available <a href="https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/sites/dartmouth.edu.faculty-directory/files/winter_cv_dec2019.pdf">here</a>.</p>

He anticipates using regional climate models to broaden our understanding of how agricultural practices are impacting the climate, while also working to improve farmer’s adaptive capacity for future impacts. Prior to coming to Dartmouth, Trevor earned a MS in Horticulture from Cornell University and a BS in Geology from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.

When not in the office, you’ll find Trevor hiking, camping, or generally exploring VT and NH with his dog Winifred, cooking, or attempting to bake bread.</p>

Her research uses regional climate modeling to predict future climate change in this region. Before landing in New Hampshire, Charlotte earned a BS in Earth System Science from McGill University in Montreal. Charlotte also worked in McGill’s Global HydroLAB, studying the causes and impacts of river intermittency at a global scale.

Outside of work, Charlotte enjoys skiing, embroidery, hiking, and making very lopsided vases in the ceramics studio.</p>

                <p>Christopher Picard is an undergraduate assisting with analyzing mean and extreme precipitation changes across the Northeast United States using regional climate model simulations and observational data sets. Chris entered Dartmouth planning on studying earth sciences, and his introduction to climate modeling began when he met Charlotte Cockburn (MS student in the Department of Earth Sciences) who was his TA in EARS 1. Chris plans to major in Earth Sciences and has an interest in pursuing climate research following graduation. Outside of academics, Chris is a member of the Men’s Club Hockey team and enjoys playing golf, hiking, lifting weights, and spending time with his dog</p>
