<p>The Applied Hydroclimatology Group at Dartmouth is recruiting an M.S. or Ph.D. student to explore the current and future sustainability of agriculture in the United States.  The successful applicant will use regional climate and crop models to advance projections of US climate, water supply, and irrigated agricultural production, as well as assess tradeoffs between energy and food production.  A background in agricultural science, atmospheric science, or hydrology and experience with programming are preferred but not required.</p>

<p>Graduate students can join the Applied Hydroclimatology Group through either the Ecology, Evolution, Environment, and Society (EEES) Graduate Program (<a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/EEES">https://sites.dartmouth.edu/EEES</a>, Ph.D. only) or the Department of Earth Sciences (EARS) Graduate Program (<a href="https://earthsciences.dartmouth.edu/graduate">https://earthsciences.dartmouth.edu/graduate</a>, M.S. or Ph.D.).  This position provides tuition, health insurance, and a monthly stipend.  Applicants are encouraged to email Jonathan (jwinter@dartmouth.edu) with any questions, and apply by December 1st, 2023 (EEES) or December 15th, 2023 (EARS) to receive full consideration.</p>

          <h4>Agriculture</h4>
          <p>Agriculture is inherently vulnerable to changing climate.  Climate-smart management decisions have the potential to improve agriculture’s adaptive capacity
            and reduce climate change impacts. We improve the understanding of historical and future food systems by analyzing climate variability, developing future 
            climate scenarios, and exploring the relationship between agricultural systems and local climate.</p>

          <h4>Northeast Precipitation</h4>
          <p>The Northeastern United States has experienced a substantial increase in heavy precipitation over the last century. We characterize the temporal 
            and spatial attributes of this increase, investigate the climatological mechanisms that have led to enhanced heavy precipitation, and explore the 
            implications of extreme precipitation on flooding.</p>

          <p>Irrigated croplands are essential to food production and responsible for the vast majority of human water consumption. Crop models have the potential 
            to inform the management and expansion of irrigation to reduce global hunger, but typically have simplistic representations of irrigation. We are developing 
            new models and frameworks to better understand the future of irrigated agricultural systems.</p>

            disease prevalence, with a focus on the role of climate and land cover.</p>

        The global agricultural sector faces the
        significant challenge of feeding a
        population projected to increase to 9
        billion by mid-century under an evolving
        climate. This course will explore the      
        physical geography of agricultural
        production systems throughout the
        world with an emphasis on the interactions
        between crops, climate, water, soils,

        Climate is a fundamental driver of populations,
        economies, and cultures. Over the past century,
        humans have been modifying the atmosphere
        through the emission of greenhouse gasses. This
        course will provide an overview of the Earth’s
        climate system and the physical basis, impacts,
        and societal dimensions of climate change.

        <b>GEOG 7.14:</b>
        Humans have radically altered the distribution  
        of water on Earth. We’ve built cities in deserts     
        supplied with water from hundreds of miles away,
        extracted enough groundwater to alter the Earth’s
        gravitational field, and dammed sixty-five percent 
        of global freshwater flows. This course will
        introduce students to the physical geography of
        water, survey human interactions with water through
        case studies from around the world, and explore how
        climate change and population growth will affect future
        quality and the availability of water.</p>

Before moving to the Upper Valley in the summer of 2013, Jonathan was an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University Earth Institute and a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. Jonathan received his PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his undergraduate studies at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, NY.
                  Outside of academia, Jonathan spends his time traveling, hiking, exploring VT/NH with his family (wife Teresa, sons Lucas, Nolan, and Henry, dog Taz), snowboarding, and trying to find the latest and greatest food and music.

                <p> Joseph Savage is a PhD student in the Ecology, Evolution, Environment, & Society (EEES) program. His research focuses on using computational models to investigate the impact of climate change and land cover on the historic and future expansion of Lyme disease. He is broadly interested in the community ecology of disease and the use of models to better understand the dynamics of disease and how to best manage them. His undergraduate research focused on using computational models to study how host population dynamics impact the dynamics of Lyme disease. Joseph holds a BA in Ecology & Evolution and Computational Biology from Colby College. Joseph can be found outside all year round hiking, biking, juggling, and felling trees, or inside drinking and brewing cider and other fermented beverages. </p>

          <p><b><u>Postdoctoral Researchers:</u></b> There are several Dartmouth Postdoctoral Fellowships available, including the 
		  <a href="https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/funding/faculty/postdoctoral-fellows">Neukom Institute Postdoctoral Fellows Program</a> and the <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/sof/fellowships/postdoc.html">Society of Fellows Postdoctoral Fellows Program</a>.  Finally, based on qualifications and area of research, postdoctoral positions are sometimes available directly through the group.<br>
                   <br>
            <b><u>Graduate Students:</u></b> Graduate students can join the Applied Hydroclimatology Group through either the 
		  <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/EEES/">Ecology, Evolution, Environment, and Society Graduate Program</a> (Ph.D. only) or the <a href="https://earthsciences.dartmouth.edu/graduate">Department of Earth Sciences Graduate Program</a> (M.S. or Ph.D.).  Apply by 12/15 for full consideration.<br>
            <br>
            <b><u>Undergraduate Students:</u></b> Projects currently being recruited for are posted on the Undergraduate Research Projects Database.  I am also interested in mentoring student-developed projects supported by Dartmouth Undergraduate Research and advising Department of Geography senior honors theses.
